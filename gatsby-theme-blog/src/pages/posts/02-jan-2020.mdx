This is my first post in the 100DaysOfGatsby challenge.

I am really excited to participate in this challenge and gain all the perspective that I can get out of this.

When this was announced in twitter, I was really excited:

I performed my first Challenge of creating a custom blog theme and posting my status here.

I will continue to take up all the rest of the challenges and work on them.

I wish good luck to everyone who is taking up these challenges.
